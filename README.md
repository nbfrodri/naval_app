# Naval AI Processor - Indesia Hackathon Demo

## ⚓ Overview

This project is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** developed for the **Indesia Hackathon**, focusing on **Navantia's** challenge to modernize naval engineering workflows.

The **Naval AI Processor** demonstrates the power of **Agentic AI** in processing **CONOPS (Concept of Operations)** documents. It utilizes a multi-agent system to automatically analyze technical PDFs, extract critical requirements, and identify key operational parameters, streamlining the generation of **SRS (Software Requirements Specifications)**.

## 🎯 Hackathon Objective

The core goal of this demo is to showcase how AI Agents can assist in the early stages of naval ship design by:
1.  **Ingesting CONOPS**: Reading complex PDF documentation related to naval operations.
2.  **Intelligent Processing**: Using AI agents to parse, understand, and categorize technical information.
3.  **Requirements Extraction**: Automatically generating structured requirements (SRS) from unstructured operational descriptions.
4.  **Parameter Identification**: Extracting key metrics and constraints essential for the engineering phase.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Military-Grade UI**: A specialized, high-contrast interface designed for clarity and situational awareness.
*   **PDF Ingestion Engine**: Drag-and-drop capability for Naval Engineering PDF files.
*   **Real-time Agent Terminal**: Visual feedback of the multi-agent orchestration process (parsing, analyzing, extracting).
*   **SRS Generation**: Automated output of structured requirements based on the input CONOPS.
*   **Interactive Visualization**: Integrated PDF viewer to review the processed results side-by-side.
